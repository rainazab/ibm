# BEACON: AI-Powered Negotiation Agent
## Problem & Solution Statement (500 words)

### THE PROBLEM

Millions of people struggle to negotiate for better prices, discounts, or services—whether calling restaurants for group deals, contacting hotels for package rates, reaching government agencies for assistance, or negotiating with service providers. The barriers are significant:

- **Time Constraint**: Making 10+ calls takes hours; most people give up after 2-3 tries
- **Communication Anxiety**: Phone anxiety, language barriers, and social anxiety prevent people from advocating for themselves
- **Inconsistency**: Most people don't know what to say or how to negotiate effectively
- **Limited Access**: Those without time (hourly workers, students) can't pursue discounts and better rates

Studies show that **70% of people have never negotiated for better service rates**, not because they can't, but because the friction is too high.

The result? Billions in lost savings that people could access with professional negotiation support.

### THE SOLUTION: BEACON

BEACON is an AI-powered web application that eliminates negotiation friction through **autonomous call agents powered by watsonx.ai**.

**How it works:**

1. **User Input** (2 minutes):
   - Simple web form: "What do you need?"
   - Select category: Restaurant, Hotel, Government, Service Provider
   - Enter details: "Call Hilton hotels in Seattle for group rate discounts for 50 people"
   - Specify goals: "Get minimum 20% discount"

2. **AI Synthesis** (Watsonx.ai):
   - watsonx.ai analyzes the request and generates a personalized negotiation strategy
   - Creates natural conversation scripts based on industry best practices
   - Generates talking points and objection handlers

3. **Autonomous Agent** (Twilio):
   - BEACON places the call using Twilio
   - AI-powered voice agent (ElevenLabs) conducts natural conversation
   - Real-time sentiment analysis adapts strategy if objections arise
   - Records call and negotiation outcome

4. **Results** (Real-time):
   - User sees call outcome immediately
   - Option to accept/reject negotiated terms
   - Receives confirmation details via email

### TARGET USERS

- **Individuals**: Students, budget-conscious families, hourly workers
- **Small Businesses**: Entrepreneurs negotiating supplier rates
- **Organizations**: NGOs seeking donations and discounts

### KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

**1. AI-Driven Strategy** - watsonx.ai generates context-specific negotiation strategies, not generic scripts

**2. Autonomous Execution** - The agent doesn't just make calls; it negotiates intelligently with real-time adaptation

**3. Measurable Results** - Users get quantified savings (dollars, discounts %, outcomes achieved)

**4. Minimal User Effort** - 2-minute setup vs. hours of calling

**5. Real Human Outcomes** - Unlike chatbots, this creates actual value through real negotiations

### THE CREATIVE DIFFERENCE

Most AI solutions focus on automation for convenience (like ordering food). BEACON focuses on **economic empowerment**—giving regular people access to the negotiation power typically only available to corporations.

We're not replacing human negotiators; we're democratizing negotiation expertise through AI.
